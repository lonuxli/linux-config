These scripts were inspired, and largely copied, from Luis Rodriguez's blog
post:

http://www.do-not-panic.com/2014/07/applying-patches-from-mutt-onto-git.html
(Be sure to view the source if you read the muttrc or the <> commands will be
hidden as html tags)

Which was itself inspired from Ben Hutchings earlier blog:

http://flavioleitner.blogspot.com/2011/03/patch-workflow-with-mutt-and-git.html

To use:

Edit the hardcoded project path in the scripts (~/source/linux/linux-pdx86) to
your preferred location. This is where "git am" and "scripts/checkpatch" will be
run from.

$ cp * ~/bin/mutt/
$ mkdir ~/incoming
$ cat muttrc >> ~/.muttrc

Dependencies:
- git
- procmail
- formail
- mutt
(at least)
